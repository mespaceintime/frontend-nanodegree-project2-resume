frontend-nanodegree-resume-builder
===============================

This is my resume builder for project 2 of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree]
(https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001).

This project provided experience with object-oriented Javascript and the HTML5 Canvas.

**Associated Udacity courses include:**

* [JavaScript Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud804-nd)
* [Intro to jQuery](hhttps://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud245-nd)

**Goal of the Project:**

* In this project you will write the JavaScript that powers your own interactive resume.

*This project is meant to be completed while taking the JavaScript Basics course. Throughout the course you'll build your resume by writing a JS script that will combine your personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate your resume.

**Bonus:**

* Added addition content to the resume in the form of office hours.

**Results:**

An error free resume with all the basic requirements meet.
